## Abstract
Our FPA-FOD-Plus mapping website takes data that was compiled from Dr. Mojtaba Sadegh and displays the data onto a map. This data is in the form of a heat map, or using circles that show fire intensity. The data can be filtered out by various variables. The end-user can also download the dataset and look through it themselves.
