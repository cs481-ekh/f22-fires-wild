## Abstract
### Project Statement
Our goal was to disply wildfire data graphically, and make the data easily and readily available for use. Visualizing the dataset can help minimize our impact on nature with repect to wildfires using data that was compiled by Dr. Mojtaba Sadegh and Yavar Pourmohamad.

This project has only 1 main page that the user will interact with. It contains a map and a filter pane. The end-user will be able to see two different visualizations. A heatmap, or points. The heatmap is a multicolor visualizer that will show red colors in areas of large fires, or an area where many fires have occured. When users zoom in or out, the heat map will change the heatmapping to show the area that is in view, and not the entire dataset. If a user wants to see individual fires, they can use the point view. Where each fire has a point, and can view the data that is associated with that fire. The user can then either download the entire dataset, or download the filtered dataset that they have chosen. 
Site admins will be able to use the Django admin center to add more data into the database that holds each fire record is stored in, and also manage existing records. Once added to the database, each fire will show up in the map.
